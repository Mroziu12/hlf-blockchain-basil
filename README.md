# HLF Blockchain Basil

## Overview
This project is built using **Hyperledger Fabric**, starting from a template and extending it to learn about blockchain concepts like smart contracts, permissioned networks, and distributed ledgers. It's nothing fancy, but it gets the job done.

## What I Learned
- Setting up and running a Hyperledger Fabric network.
- Writing and testing chaincode (smart contracts) in Go.
- Basics of managing identities and transactions in a permissioned blockchain.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Hyperledger Fabric:** For building the blockchain network.
- **Languages:** Java (chaincode and app), Bash, JavaScript.
- **Docker:** For containerization.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mroziu12/hlf-blockchain-basil.git
   cd hlf-blockchain-basil
   ```
2. Start the network:
   ```bash
   ./network.sh up
   ```
3. (Optional) Clean up:
   ```bash
   ./network.sh down
   ```

## Notes
This project  was created primarily for learning. Some parts could be improved
